    prompt = f"""You are a senior malware analyst. Below is the complete analysis data for a suspicious file.
Your job is to produce a structured threat intelligence report based ONLY on the data provided.
Do not invent or assume anything beyond what is in the data.

---

## File Identity
- SHA256: {data.get("file_hash")}

## UPX Analysis
{data.get("upx")}

## FLOSS String Extraction
{data.get("floss")}

## Static PE Analysis
{data.get("static")}

## Dynamic / VirusTotal Analysis
{data.get("dynamic")}

## YARA Matches
{data.get("yara")}

---

Based on the above, produce a detailed threat intelligence report with the following sections:

### 1. Executive Summary
A short paragraph (3-5 sentences) summarizing what this file is, what it does, and how dangerous it is.

### 2. Threat Classification
- Malware Family / Label
- Threat Type (trojan / backdoor / ransomware / etc.)
- Severity Level (Critical / High / Medium / Low) with justification

### 3. Technical Behavior
Describe in detail what the malware does based on the evidence:
- Network activity (C2, ports, protocols)
- Process activity (what processes it spawns or injects into)
- Persistence / evasion mechanisms
- Any anti-analysis behavior

### 4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
List all IOCs found in the data:
- Hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- IPs / Domains / URLs
- File names / paths
- Mutex / Registry keys (if any)
- Ports

### 5. Key Findings per Analysis Module
For each module, state the most important finding in 1-2 sentences:
- UPX
- FLOSS
- Static PE
- Dynamic / VT
- YARA

### 6. Risk Assessment
- Detection Rate
- Sandbox verdict vs AV verdict — any discrepancy?
- Confidence level in the analysis (High / Medium / Low) and why

### 7. Recommendations
What should a SOC analyst or incident responder do with this file?
List 3-5 concrete action items.

Rules:
- Be precise and technical
- Do not repeat the raw data, synthesize it
- If something is missing or unclear in the data, say so explicitly
- Use markdown formatting"""
